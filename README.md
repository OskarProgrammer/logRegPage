# logRegPage
Login and registration page built with basic backend built in golang. With the help of html.

To add new "record" to database.txt, use this pattern:

nickname + " " + password

examples:
admin password
username123 programming
root sudo

VERY IMPORMANT TO PLACE SPACE BETWEEN NICKNAME AND PASSWORD
